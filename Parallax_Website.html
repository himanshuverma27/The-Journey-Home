			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Richard Slavin is a young boy of nineteen years from the suburbs of Chicago who is influenced by the Beatles and the hippie culture. He, along with his friend, decide to go to Europe before starting college. During the journey, one day while meditating Richard heard his calling: India. He sets off on an incredible journey to India having all sorts of experiences on the way. Once in India, he meets many mystic yogis, gurus, spiritual teachers before he finally found his path—the Bhakti Yoga.

During his search for his life’s purpose, Radhanath Swami met and learned from various spiritual leaders like Mother Teresa, Swami Rama, Baba Ram Dass and his spiritual master Srila Prabhupada, the founder of ISKCON. He has near-death encounters during his journey as well as beautiful and unbelievable experiences of self-realization and miracles of God’s grace.

The book starts with a rather humorous and yet beautiful account of Radhanath Swami’s visit to the famous Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal. He was denied entry, but he managed to enter and have ‘darshan’ by pretending to be ‘mauni baba' (a yogi in silence). The book ends with Radhanath Swami realizing in Vrindavan that Bhakti Marga is the path for him and Srila Prabhupada is the one whom he will accept as his spiritual</p>
